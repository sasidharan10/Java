Vector

- Vector implements a dynamic array which means it can grow or shrink as required. 
Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index.
- They are very similar to ArrayList, but Vector is synchronized and has some legacy 
methods that the collection framework does not contain.
- It also maintains an insertion order like an ArrayList. Still, it is rarely used 
in a non-thread environment as it is synchronized, and due to this, it gives a 
poor performance in adding, searching, deleting, and updating its elements.
- The Iterators returned by the Vector class are fail-fast. In the case of 
concurrent modification, it fails and throws the ConcurrentModificationException.
